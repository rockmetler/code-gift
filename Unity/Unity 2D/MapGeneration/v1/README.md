# Map Generation

The 2DGenerator creates a Squared array of game objects determined by the user. So, for example: if you have a bunch of room prefabs that are 128x128px they will tesselate perfectly and give you a mass of them in a grid. Useful if you're making a simple roguelike or dungeoncrawler.
